Summary of the project

- Data* is given my a company that uses machine learning solutions in the European banking sector. In problems that include fraud detection, sentiment classification and customer intention prediction and classification. One of the customers provided data with the hope to develop a robust machine learning model that increases 
- They are looking to increase conversion rate in success rate for calls made to customers for any product that our clients offer. Towards this goal we are working on designing an ever evolving machine learning product that offers high success outcomes while offering interpretability for our clients to make informed decisions.

Success metrics are the following:

- Hit %81 or above accuracy by evaluating with 5-fold cross validation and reporting the average performance score.
- What makes the customers buy? Tell us which feature we should be focusing more on.

Files used in the repository            

- jupyter notebook: analysis can be seen in the notebooks folder 
- original data: has been deleted because of privacy reasons

Conclusion 

- The success threshold is below the actual mark of over 90% for several models tested. However, the metric is not the most appropiate for this kind of problem because of data imbalance.

- A set of features are given to the customer that have higher impact on the output. Customer should change the strategy for increasing the conversion rate
